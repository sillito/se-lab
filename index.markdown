A collection of software engineering studies that I use in a graduate course that aims to give students hands on experience with a range of research methods. The format for the course is inspired by a traditional undergraduate physics or chemistry laboratory course where students conduct experiments and write reports about their experimental results. In this course, each week the students read one software engineering research paper, do one mini study and submit a one page report. 

Note that in some cases studies will build on previous studies (involving analysis of previously collected data, for example).


1. [Comparing pair programming and code review - a controlled study](studies/pair-programming.html)
* Navigation - applying a IFT (use data from previous study)
* [ - an interview study](studies/.html)
* [XYZ - a systematic review](studies/systematic-review.html)
* [Questions and Answers on StackOverflow - coding and categorizing](studies/stackoverflow.html)
