A collection of software engineering studies that I use in a graduate course that aims to give students hands on experience with a range of research methods. The format for the course is inspired by a traditional undergraduate physics or chemistry laboratory course where students conduct experiments and write reports about their experimental results. In this course, each week the students read one software engineering research paper, do one mini study and submit a one page report. 

In some cases, studies are divided into two parts. This division is to make each study (or each part of a study) fit into one week. For example, with the first study the data collection can be done one week and the analysis the following week.

The first few studies are spelled out in detail. For later studies, you will be expected to do some of the study design.
