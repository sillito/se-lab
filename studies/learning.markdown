title: Position paper on the future of CS education

A _position paper_ is one in which the argues a position, without necessarily being able to prove that position (yet). Often it is something of a thought exercise or a look at what the future of a discipline may hold. In this "study" you will be asked to produce a two page position paper arguing about the future of Computer Science or Software Engineering education. 

_What kind of changes to anticipate in the next N years?_ Might we see changes in curriculum (i.e., content that makes up a typical CS degree), the type of instruction (online vs. class rooms), or the institutions that provide that instruction (or all of the above)?

(IMO) The best position papers are based on an understanding of current developments, technological changes and trends (supported by some statistics, say) in general. So, to do this exercise you need to consider some existing models/tools of education including emerging models. Here are a few things to consider.

* [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com/udacity) provides online CS courses offered by well known instructors for free (at least for now). They have almost immediately signed up 160,000 students and their stated mission is to "change the future of education". Other learning sites are taking a somewhat similar approach (e.g., [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and [treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/)). None of these are currently degree granting institutions.

* Sites like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) provide access to learning resources that historically might have not been widely available outside of textbooks and course lectures. 

* Similarly, many professors/universities are making their lectures available for free online (e.g., [Stanford's OpenClassroom](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/)). [MITx](http://mitx.mit.edu/) and [OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/) are about making MIT courses available online for free and also make their software platform available as open-source for other educational institutions to use. Some form of course credit or certification will be offered (but using a distinct brand, rather than MIT).

* [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/) is quite popular with the high school crowd. It combines short video instruction with exercises. Reportedly, some teachers are using it to reverse their teaching: lectures are the assigned home work (i.e., Khan Academy videos) and exercises are done in class (where the teacher can help).

* [University of Phoenix](http://www.phoenix.edu/) is a huge, for-profit university that has hundreds of thousands of students. It's programs are aimed at "working adult students", who can not easily take time off to be students, by focusing on online education.

* [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) combines an internship like funding model with intensive mentorship. Seems that many successful applications, drop out of school (or at least take a break from school) to "learn on the job".

* [Big Nerd Ranch](http://www.bignerdranch.com/) offers intensive one week programming courses that are in person (students spend the week at the "ranch") and very expensive (say, $4500). Of course there are many variations of this kind of professional training.

For any of these examples that are currently popular (or becoming popular) they are arguably worse than traditional university education, but also better along some dimension. It is worth thinking about what those quality dimensions are.

## Paper

Submit a maximum two page position paper (11pt font, normal margins, ...) with at least the following sections:

* _Current Situation:_ Help the reader understand what you see as the important current or emerging developments in the area of CS education. Can you say something about _why_ we are seeing what we are seeing?

* _Future:_ Take and defend a position about what changes you think will happen in the next N years. Your position may be an extrapolation of current trends, but should definitely be well argued.
