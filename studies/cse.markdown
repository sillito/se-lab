Software is increasingly important for studying computational science and engineering (CS&E) problems. To serve the needs of scientists and engineers, CS&E software needs to be high quality software, however, much of the software used in this context is developed by scientists or engineers with no formal computer science or software engineering training. These are professional end-user developers who are experts in the domain of the software, but who do not view themselves primarily as software developers.

In this study you will conduct and transcript an interview 

Here is a sample [informed consent form](interview-consent.html). Copy and edit this sample as appropriate. Your final version should have the University of Calgary's logo at the top.

## Background Reading

* Miller, G. (2006). [_A Scientist’s Nightmare: Software Problem Leads to Five Retractions_](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5807/1856.full). Science 314, 1856–1857.

## Setup

Recruit someone with a science or engineering background (e.g., a biology grad student) that creates or adapts software for use in CS&E endeavours. Alternatively, you may recruit  a developer (say, someone with a computer science background) that has been involved in work on CS&E software. Conduct a one hour interview with your participant and make an audio recording of the interview. Ideally, this interview would be conducted at a place where the participant can show the researcher aspects of their work. However, like any recorded interview, it is also important to find a quiet place.

In planning your study, begin by selecting a software engineering topic to focus on during your interview. You need to select a topic that your participant has experience with. Here are three possibilities:

* _Quality of trial results._ Defects in CS&E code are an increasingly important threat to the validity of scientific results analogous to the concept of construct validity in traditional scientific experimentation. Problems with an algorithm or with an underlying scientific concept being tested can lead to incorrect scientific results, as can defects within the implementation of those concepts. What kind of testing (or other QA practice) is used? What kinds of defects are they concerned with?

* _Sharing and reproducing trial results._ CS&E software is frequently modified and reconfigured, giving rise to multiple versions of the software. These versions are often developed in parallel by different investigators, and careful management of these versions is important for understanding and reproducing scientific results. How is the code managed? What (version control) tools are used? How well do they work in the CS&E context?

* _Debugging scientific results._ CS&E software development often involves combining and modifying several components, often with source code from a previous trial as a starting point. Developing new components is a less frequent, but important activity. These activities give rise to traditional software evolution challenges such as program comprehension and debugging but in an end-user development context. How well can your participant express scientific and experimental concepts using available libraries and programming tools? What debugging practices do they use? How easily can they understand how differences in the source code account for differences in the results of a scientific trial?

Once you have selected the topic of the study, break it own into a small number of _subtopics_ (say 4), and plan an initial question to being discussion on each subtopic. During the interview you will also need to ask follow up questions (to ensure you get "good" data), but of course there are hard to plan in advance.

## Transcription and summarization

Create a verbatim transcript of the interview using the audio recording. Also, create a two page summary of the interview, highlighting the host important portions. The summary should (primarily) be in the words of the participant.

## Report

Prepare a *one page* report about your study. Your report should have the following three sections.

* _Study description_. Describe your participant and his/her background. Describe the topic of the interview, the subtopics, and any modifications you made to the above setup.

* _Highlight some of the results_. You are not expected to report on a detailed analysis of your results (we'll do more analysis of this data later), but please highlight some of what you found interesting.

* _Limitations and applicability_. Reflect on the problems with this study and report on when this type of study would be applicable and when it would not be. Don't worry about limitations that are particular to our "mini" version of this study (e.g., only 1 participant) instead focus your comments more broadly on this type of study.

Your report is due in class. Please be prepared to discuss your study in class.

## Notes

Make sure none of the participants participate in studies by more than one of the students in this course.

As usual, you should feel free to adjust this study as needed. For example, you may want to cover very different topics than I have suggested, depending on the background of your participant.

Like all of the studies used in this course you are allowed to work alone or you can team up with another student and submit one report as a team. However, please do not work with the same partner more that a couple times over the term.

You are responsible for arranging rooms and equipment. **Plan a head** and ask for support if needed.
