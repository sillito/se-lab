A systematic review can be seen as a meta-study. That is, rather than conducting a new study, a systematic review is an analysis of previous studies.

## Distributed Software Development

Some successful open source systems, such as Linux and Firefox, serve as an existence proof that distributed 

Some research has shown that -- challenges. Many people believe that companies need to make distributed software development more like local development. 

## Steps

1. Decide on a research question for the study. I have listed some example questions below, but feel free to select your own as long as it is related to software engineering.

2. Decide on what sources. Try to be comprehensive

3. Determine the search query that will be used to select papers.

4. Collect list of papers. Likely a large list.

5. Select 3 of the papers from the list and read those. Share the papers you have decided to read with the class to avoid (much) duplication. 

6. Read and analyze those three papers.

## Report

_Research question:_ The question that is the basis for your systematic review.

_Sources and query:_ Describe and defend your choice of sources and the query or queries you used.

_Analytic results:_ Summarize ...

In addition to the one page report, you should also submit a list all of the papers you found. Highlight the three you used in this study.
