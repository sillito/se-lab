title: Questions and Answers

On the site [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), programmers can post a question, other programmers can answer those questions, and both questions and answers can be voted on. Stackoverlow is very popular with programmers (earlier this year they were at [95 million page views per month](http://highscalability.com/blog/2011/3/3/stack-overflow-architecture-update-now-at-95-million-page-vi.html)) and represents an interesting dataset for software engineering researchers. Here is a [summary of the number of questions that have been asked, etc](http://data.stackexchange.com/). The goal of this study is to use data from stackoverflow to gain insights into program comprehension issues and to practice open coding.

## Data collection

Develop a reasonable strategy for selecting a subset of the questions (and associated answers) on stackoverlow. Your strategy should ensure that your analysis can focus on questions that have multiple answers, including some "highly" rated answers. Based on your strategy build a [search query](http://stackoverflow.com/search) that will get you all posts matching that query. In all likelihood this search will return hundreds or thousands of results, but since this is a "mini" study your analysis should focus on only the first 20 posts returned. Archive or (at least) bookmark these posts and note the time and date you performed the query.

## Analysis

Your analysis will be based on _open coding_ and will use constant comparison (e.g., compare answers within and between questions) and iteration (revise your categorizations throughout the process). With the following guiding questions:

1. What kinds of questions are there? (Categorize these)

* What kinds answers are there? (Categorize these)

* What properties of question and answers influence the rating of those? (i.e., what makes for a "good" answer).

The categorizations suggested by questions 1 and 2 should help answer question 3.

## Report

Prepare a *one page* report about your study. Your report should have the following three sections.

* _Study description_. Describe selection criteria and associated search. Mention any setup issues that arose (things that could be improved).

* _Highlight some of the results_. Summarize your results and include a list of the dimensions you discovered. Highlight some of what you found interesting. 

* _Limitations and applicability_. Reflect on the problems with this study and report on when this type of study would be applicable and when it would not be. Don't worry about limitations that are particular to our "mini" version of this study (e.g., only 20 posts) instead focus your comments more broadly on this type of experiment.

Your report is due in class. Please be prepared to discuss your study in class.

## Notes

Be bold.

Like all of the studies used in this course you are allowed to work alone or you can team up with another student and submit one report as a team. However, please do not work with the same partner more that a couple times over the term.
