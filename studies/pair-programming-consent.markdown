This consent form, a copy of which has been given to you, is only part of the process of informed consent.  If you want more details about something mentioned here, or information not included here, you should feel free to ask.  Please take the time to read this carefully and to understand any accompanying information.

The University of Calgary Conjoint Faculties Research Ethics Board has approved this research study.

**Purpose of the Study:** This study is being conducted as part of a graduate course and its purpose is to investigate and compare two programming techniques: pair-programming and code review.

**What Will I Be Asked To Do?** You will be asked to participate in two 30 minute programming sessions. In the first session you will be paired with another participant and the two of you will be asked to perform a brief programming task. In the second session you will be asked to perform a second brief programming task or to do some code review. Your participation is voluntary and you can withdraw from the study at any time.

**What Type of Personal Information Will Be Collected?** No personal identifying information will be collected in this study, and all participants shall remain anonymous. Each session, will be recorded using screen capture video software.

**Are there Risks or Benefits if I Participate?** No significant risks are anticipated.

**What Happens to the Information I Provide?** Results from the study will be kept anonymous and in class discussion or any publications that may result from this study, pseudonyms will be used in place of names of people, places, etc. Session recordings will be stored indefinitely in a password protected form and only shared in the context of this course. Despite the researchers’ best efforts, due to the facts that segments from the screen capture video may be presented in the classroom setting, and that participants may include colleagues and peers from this course, absolute confidentiality or anonymity cannot be guaranteed. A signed copy of this consent form will be stored securely in Jonathan Sillito's office.

If you withdraw early from the study, the data collected from the partial study session will be treated in the same way.
