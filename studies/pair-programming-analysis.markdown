title: Further analysis on comparing pair programming to code review
layout: default
---

In this study you will be analyzing data collected from a previous study [comparing pair programming to code review](pair-programming.html). Your analysis will involve two main parts: (1) quantitative analysis, and (2) qualitative analysis.

## Quantitative Analysis

The focus of this analysis is on comparing the number of defects in code developed using pair programming with the code produced using solo programming (and review). In preparation for this analysis you will need to prepare a test suite for the code your participants are asked to write. After the sessions you will use a combination of your tests suite and inspection to quantify the number of defects. In this analysis do not confuse failures with defects! Specifically, you should compute the following numbers:

	DPP: Number of defects in code from pair programming
	DSP: Number of defects in code from solo programming, before review
	DCR: Number of defects caught by review

In class we will run simple statistical tests on the combined data from all students in the course.

## Qualitative Analysis

To get a richer understanding of the relationship between defects and pair programming, solo programming and review, consider the following (related) tasks/questions. Note that these tasks are exploratory in nature and you should feel free to adapt them as you see fit; the main goal is to explore interesting differences between the sessions and look for potential causal relationships.

* _Characterize the nature of the defects._ Look at each defect you discovered in your data and categorize them in some way (e.g., off-by-one, logical errors, ...). Use your field notes and the screen capture video to explore concepts/factors that can explain differences in the number or types of defects produced and or discovered in the sessions.

* _Explore how the defects were introduced._ Using the screen capture video from each session to determine how it was introduced. Similarly explore how the defect was (or was not) identified by the reviewer. Similarly, consider situations from your session where defects were avoided.

## Report

Prepare a *one page* report about your study. Your report should have the following three sections.

* _Study description_. Describe the analysis you have done. Mention issues that arose during analysis. Is there anything you wish you had done different during the data collection stage (i.e., things that would make your analysis better or easier)?

* _Highlight some of the results_. You may not have room to go through all of your results, so think hard about how to produce an overview of the most important/interesting results you found.

* _Limitations and applicability_. Reflect on the problems with this study and report on when this type of study would be applicable and when it would not be. Don't worry about limitations that are particular to our "mini" version of this study (e.g., only 2 participants) instead focus your comments more broadly on this type of experiment.

Your report is due in class. Please be prepared to discuss your study in class.

## Notes

As usual, you should feel free to adjust this study as needed. For example, you may have different analytical questions or tasks you want to cary out.

Like all of the studies used in this course you are allowed to work alone or you can team up with another student and submit one report as a team. For example, you may want to combine your analytic efforts with another student so that you have more sessions to compare.
